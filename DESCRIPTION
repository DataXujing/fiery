Description: fiery is a very flexible framework for building the server side
    logic in R. It is unoppinionated when it comes to how HTTP and WebSocket
    requests are handled and supports all levels of app complexity; from serving
    static content to full-blown dynamic web-apps. Fiery does not hold your hand
    as much as e.g. the shiny package does, but instead sets you free to create
    your web app the way you want.
